It creates an empty list space to save the input data and another for the target ID we want to analize.
Read a csv file(108061216.csv for example) as an input and turn the information into a list.
Remove all '-99.000' & '-999.000' in 'WDSD'.
Find out the maximum range in WDSD from target ID.
If successfully found, the range would be shown.
If failed, 'None' would be shown.
Briefly, we give it a csv file and choose the target ID we want, then the result(include ID) will be shown on the screen.
