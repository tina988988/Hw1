It creates an empty list space to save the input data and another for the target ID we want to analize.
First, we add a csv file(108061216.csv for example) as an input and it turns the information into a list.
Second, it removes all '-99.000' & '-999.000' in 'WDSD' 
and finds out the maximum range in WDSD from target ID.
If the range is successfully found, it will be shown.
If failed, 'None' will be shown.
Briefly, we give it a csv file and choose the target ID we want, then the result(include ID) will be shown on the screen.
